The Discord MultiTool Bot is an open-source project developed in TypeScript, inspired by well-known multipurpose bots like DraftBot, UnbelievaBoat, or Tupperbox — but with one key philosophy:
to provide a complete, powerful bot that everyone can use without paying for premium features or basic functionality.

This project has only just begun. The technical foundation is being built, the architecture is taking shape, and the first features are gradually rolling out. Development will take time: the goal isn’t to release a bare-bones bot, but to create a robust, clean, maintainable tool capable of evolving like professional bots.

The ultimate objective is for any community — big or small — to enjoy an advanced bot that is totally free, without any paywalls:

full server management

economy and mini-games

jobs, levels, quests, inventories

moderation tools and logs

advanced utilities

fun and social commands

automatic systems

In short: a multi-purpose bot, without limits, built for everyone.

This project is driven by three core principles:

🔹 1. Accessibility

No features will ever be locked behind a “premium” system.
Everyone gets 100% of the bot.

🔹 2. Transparency

The codebase is open, clear, and documented. Anyone can contribute.

🔹 3. Longevity

The project uses a strong, maintainable architecture to ensure long-term stability and growth.

The MultiTool Bot is still in its early stages, but the intention is clear:
to finally offer a complete, free, and fair Discord bot — built for communities, not profit.
